# Java Building Blocks

###### Lesson Goals

1. Get practice with IDE.
2. Learn basic Java syntax.
3. Implement simple application.

We will move through three simple parts.

1. Create new project.

   Open Intellij IDEA (Icon should be somewhere on Desktop)

Create base package.

Using "." you can create few packages in single operation.

2. Learn some Java syntax.

  * Learn variables by creating few of them.

   Think about variables like about boxes with different size and forms.
   Some of them are good for storing one things, but not good for others and vice versa.

    ```java
    int integerNumber = 5;
    ```

    ```
        /**
        * This is variable. This one is very good for integer values.
        * Key word is "int" which is part of Java syntax.
        * It's name "integerNumber" which is chosen by creator and can be user for calling it again
        * For example:
        */

    ```java
        int imNewInteger = integerNumber + integerNumber;
    ```

    ```
        /**
        * The result will be 10 because as you remember value stored in "integerNumber" variable was 10.
        *
        */
    ```
