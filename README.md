# Java Building Blocks

###### Lesson Goals

1. Get practice with IDE.
2. Learn basic Java syntax.
3. Implement simple application.

We will move through three simple parts.

1. Create new project.

2. Learn variables by creating few of them.

   Think about variables like about boxes with different size and forms.
   Some of them are good for storing one things, but not good for others and vice versa.

    ```java
        int integerNumber = 5;
    ```
