# Java Building Blocks

###### Lesson Goals

1. Get practice with IDE.
2. Learn basic Java syntax.
3. Implement simple application.

We will move through three simple parts.

1. Create new project.

   Open Intellij IDEA (Icon should be somewhere on Desktop)

   Follow tips on the pics

Double check project SDK

Create base package.

Using "." you can create few packages in single operation.

2. Learn some Java syntax.

   Learn variables by creating few of them.

   Think about variables like about boxes with different size and forms.
   Some of them are good for storing one things, but not good for others and vice versa.

    ```java
        int integerNumber = 5;

        /**
        * This is variable. This one is very good for integer values.
        * Key word is "int" which is part of Java syntax.
        * It's name "integerNumber" which is chosen by creator and can be user for calling it again
        * For example:
        */

        int imNewInteger = integerNumber + integerNumber;

        /**
        * The result value inside "imNewInteger" will be 10.
        * As you remember value stored in "integerNumber" variable was 5.
        *
        * We can store and change values inside variables using "=" symbol.
        * For example:
        */

        integerNumber = imNewInteger;

        /**
        * For this operation we dont need key word "int" in the beginning of the string.
        * Both variables already created so we just reusing them by calling their names.
        *
        * The result was 10 inside both variables.
        */

    ```

    Java has many data types (different types of boxes) which can be used for creating variables.

    When you need some variable you should chose data type which will be good for your solution.
    In previous example we've used "int" (integer data type).

    Here you can find most popular Java data types (their key words) with examples of data.


    ```java
        double imDouble = 0.3;

        char imCharacter = 'a';

        boolean imBoolean = false;  //boolean can be only true or false

        String imString = "I'm String!"

        /**
        * Maybe you've found difference between "String" and other key words. Yes "String" starts from capital letter.
        * It means "String" is an object, but it's another topic... for now just keep it in mind.
        */
    ```

    Now lets learn some methods.

    ```java
        public void doSomething(double imDouble) {

        }

        /**
        * There is method! Lets dive in some details.
        * Methods it's places where we can put our code and call it after from some other part of the program.
        * Explanation can be much more wider and deeper, but for now it is enough.
        *
        * Let's check our example.
        * "public" means this method visible anywhere in our appliation
        *
        * "void" means the method will not return any result values.
        * Yes we can count on some result values from the methods, but today we skip it.
        *
        * "doSomething" this is method name which can be chosen by creator and should be very informative.
        *
        * (double imDouble) this is arguments, looks like creating variable. And yes inside method "doSomething"
        * we will have variable "imDouble". Value stored inside "imDouble" will be taken from calling place.
        * But againg it's another topic.
        * Methods can have 0 to as much as you need number of arguments, but if you put more then 3 it looks ugly.
        *
        * {  } this bracers called scope. In our case is method scope.
        * Anything we put inside will be part of method's scope and will be executed when the method will be called.
        */
    ```

3. So now lets code something.

    Write simple application

    Create new Class.

    ![](https://github.com/akhambir/JavaBuildingBlocks/blob/master/resources/img/icon_5.png)

    UseCamelCaseForClassNamesStartingFromLeadCapitalLetter

    Name it as Solution

    ![](https://github.com/akhambir/JavaBuildingBlocks/blob/master/resources/img/icon_6.png)

    The code challenge is:

    * Inside Class scope write the method named "printMyVariables" with one argument "double".
    * Create inside method scope another integer variable (key word "int").
    * Copy and paste code below inside Class scope but not inside created method.

    ```java
        public static void main(String[] args) {
                Solution solution = new Solution();
                solution.printMyVariables(4.2);
        }
    ```

    * Use command below for print your variables. For printing just copy and paste it inside created method
    and put your variable around bracers.

    ```java
        System.out.println();
    ```

    Hint: for printing variable use single line, single command and single variable of course.

    * In the end push "Run"

![](https://github.com/akhambir/JavaBuildingBlocks/blob/master/resources/img/icon_11.png)



   Valid program will print in console two lines. One with double value "4.2" another with your chosen integer value.
   If you will see some errors then read again the page and try fix the problem.

   Good luck!!!
